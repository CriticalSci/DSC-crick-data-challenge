# Data Science Case: ATAC+RNA-Seq Analysis Challenge

**What is this?**  
In this repo you will find a _bundle_ of data, code and notebooks for reproducibly generating and showcasing the analyses applied to solve a specific data science case (DSC).

**Why is this here?**  
Learning and training â€“ feel free to clone and re-run the analysis and suggest how it could be improved :)
I will update it incrementally as my own skills and knowledge develop.

**About the Case**
We are tasked to analyse (within 2 weeks) processed ATAC-Seq and RNA-Seq datasets derived from an experiment comparing treatment vs control.
All we know about the context is that the treatment group is thought to activate a transcriptional program via remodelling of the chromatin structure.

**Aims**
1. Identify genes that may be regulated in this fashion.
2. Identify the possible transcriptional programs involved.
3. Present candidate transcription factors that may be responsible for the underlying regulation.

**Note**: [This commit](https://github.com/CriticalSci/DSC-crick-data-challenge/tree/884939f1c5f33f26edaa2808860fa806a5227ad6) represents the bundle as it was delivered for assessment after 2 weeks work (21/10/2019).
